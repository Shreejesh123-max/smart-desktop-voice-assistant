# Smart Desktop Voice Assistant 🎙️

This is a simple Smart Desktop Voice Assistant built using Python.  
It listens to your voice commands and performs tasks like opening apps, searching the web, telling time, and basic system operations — just like a mini JARVIS on your computer.

I built this project to explore speech recognition, automation, and real-world Python applications.
